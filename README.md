# INNOV8 Hackathon: Alien Communication Decoding

This project predicts alien species from intercepted messages using a **Random Forest Classifier**. The model is trained on attributes like message content, number of fingers, and presence of a tail, applying feature encoding and data preprocessing for improved classification accuracy.
